## Does this mean `deno` is ready for production?

Good heavens, no. This was a *pain* to write. I can't even create a `side dev` command,
since there is currently no working way to get cross-platform file watching under deno.

## Can I see the source for this site?

Yes! It's in the docs folder [on GitHub](https://github.com/half-cambodian-hacker-man/side).
